Snowflake Gold Layer:

fact_transactions, dim_customer, dim_channel, dim_geo_location

Tableau Visualizations:

Unusual transactions by type, amount, or time

Heatmap of high-risk geographies

Trendlines showing sudden spikes

Alerts:

Set Tableau data-driven alerts for fraud thresholds (e.g., >10K USD in under 2 min)

## ✅ Use Case 3: Loan Portfolio Performance Dashboard
Objective: Monitor the health and performance of loan products across geographies.

Snowflake Gold Layer:

fact_loan_performance, dim_product, dim_customer, dim_branch

Tableau Visualizations:

KYC pending % by branch

Breach of transaction limits

SLA compliance trendlines

Exports:

Generate PDF or CSV reports monthly/quarterly for audit submission

🔗 Tableau-Snowflake Integration Highlights:
Use live connection for real-time data or extracts for performance.

Secure access using Snowflake OAuth or SAML SSO.

Parameterize dashboards using Tableau filters, sets, and actions.

Would you like sample dashboard layouts, SQL queries for Gold layer views, or integration steps (Snowflake ↔ Tableau) for one of these use cases?

To connect Snowflake with Tableau, follow these steps for a secure and optimized integration:

🔗 Step-by-Step: Connect Tableau to Snowflake
✅ Pre-requisites
Snowflake Account (with role and permissions to access the database)

Tableau Desktop or Tableau Cloud/Tableau Server

Snowflake ODBC driver (optional for desktop; Tableau handles this internally)

🛠️ Step 1: Get Snowflake Connection Details
You’ll need:

Account (e.g., xy12345.east-us-2.azure)

Warehouse (e.g., ANALYTICS_WH)

Database (e.g., FINANCE_DB)

Schema (e.g., GOLD_LAYER)

Username & Password or SSO credentials (OAuth/SAML)

🖥️ Step 2: In Tableau Desktop
Open Tableau Desktop

Click “Connect” → “To a Server” → “Snowflake”

Enter the following:

Server: <your_account>.snowflakecomputing.com

Warehouse: ANALYTICS_WH

Database: FINANCE_DB

Schema: GOLD_LAYER

Authentication:

Basic (username/password)

OR OAuth for SSO/SAML

Click “Sign In”

🧮 Step 3: Choose Tables/Views
Navigate to the GOLD_LAYER schema

Drag and drop tables or views like fact_transaction_summary, dim_customer, etc.

You can also write custom SQL by clicking "New Custom SQL"

📊 Step 4: Build Your Dashboard
Start creating sheets and dashboards with dimensions/measures

Use Tableau features like:

Filters, Parameters

Dashboard Actions

Tooltips, Highlights

Extracts for performance optimization

☁️ For Tableau Cloud/Tableau Server
To connect Tableau Cloud or Server to Snowflake:

Add a Snowflake connection via Web Authoring or Data Sources tab

Use OAuth for secure authentication (preferred)

Schedule refreshes or live connections as per your business need

Use Tableau Bridge if your Snowflake is behind a firewall (for Cloud)

✅ Best Practices
Category	Best Practice
Security	Use OAuth/SAML SSO for authentication
Performance	Use Extracts for large dashboards
Optimization	Use filters, partitions, clustering in Snowflake
Governance	Access only GOLD Layer Views (not raw tables)
Refresh Strategy	Schedule extract refreshes or use Live where needed
