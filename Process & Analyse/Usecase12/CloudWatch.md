To monitor your AWS Glue job that writes to Snowflake using CloudWatch Logs, follow these steps to enable and use CloudWatch Logs effectively for observability, auditing, and alerting.

# ✅ Step-by-Step: Enable & Use CloudWatch Logs for Glue Jobs
## 🧾 1. Enable Logging in AWS Glue Job
When you create or edit your Glue job:

Go to Glue Console → Jobs → Create or Edit Job

Under Monitoring options:

✅ Enable Continuous logging

✅ Enable Job metrics

✅ Set Log group name, e.g., /aws-glue/jobs/output

Set Log stream prefix, e.g., glue-to-snowflake

This will allow you to track every run and debug errors like JDBC failures, data format mismatches, etc.

## 📂 2. Location of Logs in CloudWatch
Once the job runs:

Go to CloudWatch Console → Logs → Log Groups

Look for /aws-glue/jobs/output

Inside, you’ll see log streams named like:

arduino
Copy
Edit
glue-to-snowflake/job-run-abc123
## 🔍 3. Example Logs You Might See
You’ll be able to see:

Type	Example
🟢 Success	Job completed successfully.
❌ Snowflake Error	SQL compilation error: Table does not exist.
⚠️ PySpark Warning	WARN scheduler.TaskSetManager: Lost task 0.0 in stage 0.0
🔐 Auth Error	Invalid credentials for Snowflake

## 🔔 4. Set Up CloudWatch Alerts
To receive notifications on failures (e.g., Glue job fails to write to Snowflake):

A. Create Metric Filter
Go to CloudWatch → Logs → Log Groups → Select your group.

Create a filter with pattern:

arduino
Copy
Edit
"ERROR"
Assign a metric name: GlueJobErrors.

B. Create Alarm
Go to CloudWatch → Alarms → Create Alarm

Select GlueJobErrors metric

Set condition: >= 1 within 1 period

Add an action: send email/SNS notification to alert team

🧠 Tips & Best Practices
Practice	Description
Structured Logs	Use print(f"[INFO] Record Count: {count}") in PySpark to track state.
Retry Policy	Configure max retry attempts in Glue Job settings.
Job Timeout	Set a timeout in case of hanging jobs (e.g., JDBC stalled).
Log Retention	Configure retention period (e.g., 30 or 90 days) for cost control.
Use Tags	Tag jobs with env:prod, pipeline:snowflake_ingest etc. for filtering.
