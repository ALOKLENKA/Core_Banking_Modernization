Oracle GoldenGate is a powerful, real-time Change Data Capture (CDC) and replication tool frequently used in banking and financial services projects‚Äîespecially when integrating on-premises systems like Flexcube (OLTP on Oracle DB) with cloud-based data lakes like AWS S3.

‚úÖ Use Case Scenario
Project Context: Core banking application using Oracle Flexcube on-premise with Oracle Database.
Business wants to move transactional data (e.g., accounts, customers, payments) to AWS S3 for reporting, analytics, fraud detection, or ML workloads‚Äîin near real-time.

üîÑ Step-by-Step Data Flow
1. Extract from Oracle (Flexcube)
GoldenGate uses Extract process to read Redo Logs or Archived Logs from Oracle DB.

It captures inserts, updates, deletes on target Flexcube tables (e.g., CUST_ACCOUNT, LOANS, PAYMENTS).

2. Trail File Creation
Captured changes are written to GoldenGate Trail Files, which store CDC data in a proprietary format.

3. Replicate to AWS
GoldenGate Replicat process reads Trail Files.

If using GoldenGate for Big Data, the Replicat is configured to write directly to AWS S3 using a handler (e.g., JSON/Avro/Parquet format).

Data is securely transferred via AWS Direct Connect or VPN.

4. GoldenGate Big Data Adapter
Uses S3 Handler to write CDC data as:

JSON or Avro records (row-level)

Optionally use partitioning based on timestamp/date (e.g., /year/month/day/)

Can compress files as .gz or .snappy.

5. AWS S3 Landing Zone
All Flexcube CDC data lands in raw/bronze layer of the S3 data lake.

From there, data can be processed using:

AWS Glue (ETL)

Athena/Redshift Spectrum (query)

Amazon EMR / PySpark

Lake Formation (for governance)

üîê Security & Governance
Data encrypted at rest in S3 (SSE-S3 or SSE-KMS)

In-transit encryption via TLS

Fine-grained access control via IAM + Lake Formation

üß™ Typical Use Cases
Real-time reporting on accounts and transactions

Fraud monitoring pipelines

Customer 360 view using ML models

Generating regulatory reports (Basel, AML, etc.)

üß∞ GoldenGate Configuration Notes
Use Integrated Extract for Oracle 12c+ (reads from redo logs directly)

Use Replicat in Big Data mode with S3 Handler

Common configuration properties in ogg.properties for S3:
